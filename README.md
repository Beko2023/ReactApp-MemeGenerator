Meme generator sends a fetch request to a meme generator API and stores it as a state. Once the user pushes the button, a random number is generated to pick a meme index from the state to render to user.

Text inputs are equal to the State that are altered as the user inputs data. This allows the user to display the text on the images real-time.
